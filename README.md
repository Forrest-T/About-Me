# About-Me
(WIP)
General Information about myself and my current/previous projects

## Education
* I am currently a fourth-year computer science student at the University of Washington, Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering. I've taken a wide range of exploratory courses, and my current focus is on low-level systems development.
* In 2017-2018, I studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

## Previous Experience
### Floating-Point Verification Researcher
In 2018, I worked on formal verification of floating-point arithmetic for embedded C-systems at Scania. I have an experience report available in docs/float.pdf. My work focused both on the application of existing open-source tools to an industrial environment, and on what we were able to prove formally when those tools were insufficient.
